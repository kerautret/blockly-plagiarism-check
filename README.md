# blockly-plagiarism-check
This script matches variable IDs from XML files generated under blockly. It searches a folder and its subfolders (generated by a moodle platform) for all .txt files and tries to decode the xml content when possible.

This was developed under python 3

Libraries used:
- Path.py ( https://pypi.org/project/path.py/ )
- lxml ( https://lxml.de/ ) 
- chardet ( https://pypi.org/project/chardet/ )

Simply modify the path on the "analyzeDir" variable and run the script.

A sample folder (.zip file) is provided to see how the data is supposed to be shaped
